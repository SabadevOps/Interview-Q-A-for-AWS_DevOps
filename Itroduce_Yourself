🎀### **🔟 What are the stages in Jenkinsfile?**

Common stages in a Jenkins pipeline (Jenkinsfile) are:

1. **Checkout** – Pull code from Git.
2. **Build** – Compile or build the application (e.g., using Maven or npm).
3. **Test** – Run unit or integration tests.
4. **Package** – Create artifacts or Docker images.
5. **Deploy** – Deploy to a test, staging, or production environment.
6. **Notify** – Send notifications (e.g., email or Slack) about build status.

Example snippet:

```groovy
pipeline {
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') { steps { git 'https://github.com/repo.git' } }
        stage('Build') { steps { sh 'mvn clean package' } }
        stage('Test') { steps { sh 'mvn test' } }
        stage('Deploy') { steps { sh './deploy.sh' } }
    }
}
```
