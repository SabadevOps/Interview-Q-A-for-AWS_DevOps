## üîß **Linux Basics & Fundamentals**

1. **What is Linux?**
   Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that forms the basis of distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, and Amazon Linux.

2. **Difference between Linux and Unix?**
   Unix is proprietary; Linux is open-source and community-driven. Linux supports multiple hardware architectures and is free.

3. **What are runlevels in Linux?**
   Runlevels define the state of a machine, like shutdown (0), single-user mode (1), multi-user mode (3), GUI mode (5).

4. **How do you check Linux kernel version?**
   `uname -r` or `cat /proc/version`

5. **What are environment variables?**
   Variables that define system behavior, e.g., `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`.

6. **How do you set a permanent environment variable?**
   Add `export VAR=value` to `~/.bashrc` or `/etc/profile`.

7. **Difference between soft link and hard link?**
   Soft link (symlink) is a pointer to a file path; hard link is another reference to the same inode.

8. **What is the default shell in Linux?**
   Bash (`/bin/bash`), though other shells exist (zsh, sh, ksh).

9. **How to switch between users?**
   Use `su username` or `sudo -i` to switch to root.

10. **What is the difference between absolute and relative paths?**
    Absolute starts from `/`; relative is based on the current directory.

## üìÇ **File System & Permissions**

11. **How do you check disk space usage?**

14. **Explain Linux file permissions.**
    Three types: Read (r), Write (w), Execute (x) for User, Group, Others.

    `chown user:group file`

17. **What is sticky bit?**
    Special permission that allows only the owner/root to delete files inside a directory.

18. **Difference between `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`?**
    `/etc/passwd` contains user info; `/etc/shadow` contains encrypted passwords.

19. **How to list hidden files?**
    `ls -la`

20. **What is inode in Linux?**
    Metadata structure that stores information about files (permissions, owner, size, etc.).
