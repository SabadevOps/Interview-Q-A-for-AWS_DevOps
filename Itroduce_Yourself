My name is Nuzhat Saba, and I’m from Jharkhand. I am currently working as an AWS DevOps Engineer, where I have hands-on experience with major AWS services such as ECS, EKS, EC2, RDS, Load Balancers, S3, and IAM.
In addition to AWS, I work with a wide range of DevOps tools — including Terraform and CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code, Ansible for configuration management,
ELK stack for logging, and Prometheus with Grafana for monitoring.
